# Requirements Document

## Introduction
The Project Onboarding System provides a standardized, markdown-based approach to efficiently guide both human developers and AI agents through project familiarization. This system creates structured documentation workflows that reduce onboarding time and ensure consistent knowledge transfer across projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Onboarding Documentation Structure
**Objective:** As a project maintainer, I want a standardized markdown documentation structure, so that both humans and agents can efficiently discover and consume project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a new project is initialized THEN the Onboarding System SHALL create a predefined directory structure with essential onboarding documents
2. IF a project lacks required onboarding files THEN the Onboarding System SHALL generate templates with placeholder content
3. WHERE an onboarding.md file exists THE Onboarding System SHALL validate it contains required sections (overview, setup, architecture, contributing)
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the Onboarding System SHALL maintain cross-references between related documents

### Requirement 2: Human Developer Onboarding
**Objective:** As a new human developer, I want guided step-by-step onboarding instructions, so that I can quickly become productive on the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a human accesses the onboarding documentation THEN the Onboarding System SHALL present a clear progression path with checkboxes
2. IF environment setup is required THEN the Onboarding System SHALL provide platform-specific installation instructions
3. WHILE following setup instructions THE Onboarding System SHALL validate completion of each step before proceeding
4. WHERE code examples are provided THE Onboarding System SHALL ensure they are executable and up-to-date

### Requirement 3: AI Agent Onboarding
**Objective:** As an AI agent, I want structured project context in machine-readable format, so that I can understand project structure, dependencies, and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an AI agent requests project context THEN the Onboarding System SHALL provide structured metadata about the project
2. IF project conventions exist THEN the Onboarding System SHALL document coding standards, naming patterns, and architectural decisions
3. WHERE dependencies are defined THE Onboarding System SHALL maintain an up-to-date dependency map with version constraints
4. WHEN analyzing codebase structure THEN the Onboarding System SHALL provide directory hierarchy and module relationships

### Requirement 4: Interactive Onboarding Workflows
**Objective:** As a user (human or agent), I want interactive onboarding experiences, so that I can receive personalized guidance based on my role and experience level.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN starting onboarding THEN the Onboarding System SHALL assess user type (human/agent) and experience level
2. IF a user selects a specific role THEN the Onboarding System SHALL customize the onboarding path for that role
3. WHILE progressing through onboarding THE Onboarding System SHALL track completion status and allow resuming
4. WHERE additional help is needed THE Onboarding System SHALL provide contextual assistance and resources

### Requirement 5: Content Management and Maintenance
**Objective:** As a project maintainer, I want automated content validation and maintenance, so that onboarding documentation remains accurate and current.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN code changes are committed THEN the Onboarding System SHALL check if onboarding documentation needs updates
2. IF documentation references become invalid THEN the Onboarding System SHALL flag broken links and outdated information
3. WHILE documentation is being authored THE Onboarding System SHALL provide templates and style guidelines
4. WHERE multiple contributors edit documentation THE Onboarding System SHALL maintain consistency in format and structure
5. WHEN implementing the onboarding system THEN the Onboarding System SHALL review existing project documentation to identify content for integration
6. IF legacy documentation files exist (such as AGENTS.md) THEN the Onboarding System SHALL incorporate relevant content into the new documentation framework

### Requirement 6: Integration and Extensibility
**Objective:** As a development team, I want the onboarding system to integrate with existing tools, so that it fits seamlessly into our workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN integrated with version control THEN the Onboarding System SHALL automatically update documentation based on repository changes
2. IF CI/CD pipelines exist THEN the Onboarding System SHALL validate documentation as part of the build process
3. WHERE project management tools are used THE Onboarding System SHALL sync onboarding tasks with existing workflows
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the Onboarding System SHALL support plugins and custom integrations
